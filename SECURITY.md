Security reports are accepted for the active mainline of this repository and its public dependencies.

Priority areas:

- Authentication and authorization controls
- Per-client data boundaries and tenancy isolation
- Secret handling and credential exposure
- Delivery routing and recipient safety
- Replay artifact and log data leakage

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately. Do not open public issues with exploit details.

## Disclosure Rules

- No public disclosure before a fix is available.
- Maintainers will acknowledge receipt and triage severity.

## Safe Harbor

Good-faith security research is welcome. Please avoid:

- Accessing real user/client data
- Disrupting availability
- Social engineering
- Any destructive testing
